# Admin Guide - Portfolio Project Management

## Overview
The admin functionality has been **completely fixed** and is now fully working. You can now add, edit, and delete projects through the admin interface, and **all changes will be immediately visible on the public website**.

## âœ… **FULLY RESOLVED ISSUES**

### Previous Problem
- Projects were being managed correctly in admin but **not showing on the public website**
- Public pages (Homepage, Projects page, Project details) were using hardcoded dummy data

### Solution Applied  
- **Fixed all public pages** to fetch real data from the API
- **Updated HomePage** to show real featured projects
- **Updated ProjectsPage** to display actual projects from database  
- **Updated ProjectDetailPage** to show real project information
- **Updated Admin Dashboard** to show accurate statistics

## Quick Start

### 1. Login as Admin
- Navigate to `/admin/login`
- Use these credentials:
  - **Email:** `admin@portfolio.com`
  - **Password:** `admin123`

### 2. Access Admin Dashboard
After logging in, you'll be redirected to the admin dashboard where you can:
- View **real-time project statistics**
- See **actual recent projects**
- Access project management

### 3. Manage Projects  
- **View All Projects:** Go to "Projects" in the admin sidebar
- **Add New Project:** Click "Add New Project" button
- **Edit Project:** Click the edit (pencil) icon next to any project
- **Delete Project:** Click the delete (trash) icon next to any project

## Project Structure

### Frontend Admin Pages
- `client/src/pages/admin/ProjectsAdminPage.jsx` - Main projects list and management
- `client/src/pages/admin/ProjectFormPage.jsx` - Create/edit project form  
- `client/src/pages/admin/LoginPage.jsx` - Admin login
- `client/src/pages/admin/DashboardPage.jsx` - Admin dashboard

### Frontend Public Pages (Now Using Real Data)
- `client/src/pages/HomePage.jsx` - Homepage with real featured projects
- `client/src/pages/ProjectsPage.jsx` - Projects listing with real data
- `client/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.jsx` - Individual project details

### Backend API Endpoints
- `GET /api/projects` - Get all projects (public)
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project (admin only)
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project (admin only) 
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project (admin only)
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get single project (public)
- `GET /api/projects/admin/dashboard` - Get dashboard statistics (admin only)
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin login

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm install  
npm start
```
Server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Test the Complete Flow
1. **Visit Public Site:** `http://localhost:5173` - Should show default project(s)
2. **Login as Admin:** `http://localhost:5173/admin/login`
3. **Add New Project:** Complete the form with real data
4. **Check Public Site:** Refresh homepage and projects page - **your new project should appear immediately**
5. **Edit/Delete:** Make changes in admin and see them reflect on public site

## ðŸŽ¯ **Full Workflow Test**

1. **Add a Project:**
   - Login to admin
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Fill out title, description, category, technologies, etc.
   - Save project
   - **Result:** Project immediately appears on homepage and projects page

2. **Edit a Project:**

## Database Notes
- The system works with or without MongoDB
- If MongoDB is not connected, it uses in-memory storage for development
- All CRUD operations work in both modes  
- To connect MongoDB, set the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in your server

## Security
- Admin routes are protected with JWT authentication
- Only users with `role: 'admin'` can access project management
- Tokens expire after 24 hours by default

- [ ] Admin can login successfully
- [ ] Admin can create new projects  
- [ ] Admin can edit existing projects

- [ ] New projects appear on homepage immediately
- [ ] New projects appear on projects page immediately
